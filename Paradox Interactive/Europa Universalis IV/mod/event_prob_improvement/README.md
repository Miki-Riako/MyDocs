## Reject SL, Event prob improvement

只对原版文件进行了发生概率上的修改，以避免玩家频繁SL，得到良好的游戏体验。
AI不会生效，只有和玩家相关概率才会变化。
修改了概率，但并不代表一定发生或一定不发生，遇到特殊情况是可能不满足条件或你脸太黑了。

想到什么加什么，欢迎提出增加建议。


Only the original file has been modified in terms of probability to avoid frequent SL for players and get a good gaming experience.
AI will not take effect, only the probability related to the player will change.
The probability has been modified, but it does not mean that it will definitely happen or will definitely not happen. In special cases, the conditions may not be met or you may be unlucky.

Add whatever think of, welcome suggestions for additions.



### 概率增加（提升为10倍）
勃艮第：
- 勃艮第继承危机会倾向于选择玩家的情况
- 玛丽小姐坠马在玩家的情况下更容易发生

匈牙利：
- 玩家是奥地利时，会倾向于选择德意志人皇帝
- 玩家是奥地利时，会倾向于选择奥地利联统

克里米亚：
- 玩家是奥斯曼时，会倾向于选择奥斯曼卫戍

### 概率减少（下降为0.1倍）
波兰：
- 玩家是奥地利，且完成联统波兰任务前，将更难出联通立陶宛的事件(但十倍依旧容易发生，所以还是相当于很早就会必定发生)

天命：
- 地震更难发生

### 概率去除（移除）
这类事件由于只有玩家可能触发，ai永不触发，不符合常理，故移除。

天命：
- 黄河水患
- 长江水患



### Increased probability (increased to 10 times)
Burgundy:
- Burgundy succession crisis will tend to choose the player's situation
- Lady Mary's fall from horse is more likely to occur in the player's situation

Hungary;
- When the player is Austrian, it will tend to choose the German emperor
- When the player is Austrian, it will tend to choose the Austrian Union

Crimea:
- When the player is Ottoman, it will tend to choose Ottoman garrison

### Decreased probability (decreased to 0.1 times)
Poland:
- If the player is Austrian and before completing the Union Poland mission, it will be more difficult to get the Lithuanian Union event (but it is still more likely to happen in ten times, so it is still equivalent to a certain occurrence very early)

Destiny:
- Earthquakes are less likely to occur

### Probability removal (removed)
This type of event is removed because it is not in line with common sense because only players can trigger it and AI will never trigger it.

Destiny:
- Yellow River floods
- Yangtze River floods
